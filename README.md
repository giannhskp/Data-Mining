## Project 2 - Fake/True News Classification
Given a dataset with news articles we should train a model that classifies each article as fake or True.
We try different ways to represent the text of each article, such as:
  - Bag Of Words 
  - TF-IDF
  - Word2Vec

Also, we use different models in order to compare their performance.
The models that we used are:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Naive Bayes
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Random Forest

Finaly we compare the performance between every combination of representation/model.
